## Instructions for Setup & Deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthras/z-i-c-c
cd z-i-c-c
yarn
```

In the folder itself, create a .env file with the following parameters:

```env
API_URL=
USERNAME=
PASSWORD=
```

The details needed for the .env file are supplied in the email sent with this application. 

If this fails, the email also contains a zip file which contains the .env file with the necessary details.
